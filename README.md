Have you ever spent more than a minute swiping through the Emoji Keyboard looking for a particular emoji? You know it exists, but swear you can't find it. Ever even just give up?
Paste eases that frustration. Instead of swiping around for a particularly hard to find emoji or giving up, just open up Paste and search for it by name. When you select one of the search results, the emoji is immediately copied. Go back to the original app and just paste it in.


## Run Paste in Xcode
Want to get the app running as an OSS project? Install [Carthage](http://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) if you haven't already and run this in your shell:
```
git clone https://github.com/dasmer/Paste.git
cd Paste
rake
open Paste.xcodeproj
```

You will have a running version of the Paste app by hitting Build > Run
